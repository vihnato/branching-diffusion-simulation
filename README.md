# branching-diffusion-simulation
Implicating the Branching Diffusion model into the practice using Monte Carlo Simulation

### main.py 
TODOs \
Finilize the script
- ✅edit the utils and main script (edit comments, variables, algo) 
- place the dots as on the plot from overleaf
- ✅separate the functions (e.g. create a separate script for plots)
Write a new script for computation of r.v. 
Try to imply gbm for diffusion in branching process

Check the assumptions for the model, find a counterexample 
that shows the necessity of assumptions.

Check the algo
