# branching-diffusion-simulation
Implicating the Branching Diffusion model into the practice using Monte Carlo Simulation

### main.py 
TODOs \
Finilize the script
- edit the utils and main script (edit comments, variables, algo)
- place the dots as on the plot from overleaf
- separate the functions (e.g. create a separate script for plots)
Write a new script for computation of r.v. 
Try to imply gbm for diffusion in branching process
